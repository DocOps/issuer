      # Milestone Creation Test
      
      This issue tests automatic milestone creation functionality.
      
      **What this tests:**
      - Creating a new milestone when it doesn't exist
      - Associating an issue with a newly created milestone
      - The `--auto-versions` or `--auto-metadata` flag functionality
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      1. A new milestone called "test-milestone-v1.0" should be created
      2. This issue should be associated with that milestone
      3. The milestone should appear in the repository's Milestones section
      
      **Test commands:**
      ```bash
      # With manual confirmation
      issuer 03-milestone-tests.yml
      
      # With automatic creation (no prompts)
      issuer 03-milestone-tests.yml --auto-versions
      issuer 03-milestone-tests.yml --auto-metadata
      ```
      
  - summ: "[TEST] Issue with existing milestone"
    body: |
      # Existing Milestone Test
      
      This issue should use the same milestone as the previous issue, testing that:
      
      - The CLI can find and reuse existing milestones
      - Multiple issues can be assigned to the same milestone
      - No duplicate milestones are created
      
      This issue should be associated with the "test-milestone-v1.0" milestone.
    vrsn: test-milestone-v1.0
    
  - summ: "[TEST] Issue with different milestone"
    body: |
      # Multiple Milestone Test
      
      This issue tests creating and using a second milestone.
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      - A new milestone "test-milestone-v2.0" should be created
      - This issue should be associated with the new milestone
      - Both milestones should exist in the repository
      
      This tests the ability to handle multiple milestones in a single operation.
    vrsn: test-milestone-v2.0
