      # Assignment Test
      
      This issue tests the user assignment functionality.
      
      **What this tests:**
      - Assigning an issue to a specific user
      - User validation (the user must have access to the repository)
      - Assignment display in the GitHub interface
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      - This issue should be assigned to the repository owner/collaborator
      - The assignee should appear in the GitHub Issues interface
      - The assignee should receive notifications (if configured)
      
      **Important:** Make sure to update the `user` field below with a valid GitHub username that has access to the test repository.
      
      **Test commands:**
      ```bash
      issuer 05-assignment-tests.yml --dry  # Check assignment before posting
      issuer 05-assignment-tests.yml        # Create with assignment
      ```
    user: briandominick               # GitHub username  # Update this with a valid GitHub username
    
  - summ: "[TEST] Issue with default assignee"
    body: |
      # Default Assignee Test
      
      This issue tests using a default assignee specified in metadata defaults.
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      - Should be assigned to the same user as specified in defaults
      - Tests the inheritance of user assignment from metadata
      
      Note: This test requires setting a default user in the metadata section.
    # This issue will use the default user from $meta.defaults if specified
    
  - summ: "[TEST] Unassigned issue"
    body: |
      # Unassigned Issue Test
      
      This issue should remain unassigned to test that:
      
      - Issues without explicit or default assignees work correctly
      - The assignment field is properly omitted from the API call
      - No errors occur when no assignee is specified
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      - This issue should appear with no assignee in GitHub
      - No assignment-related errors should occur during creation
