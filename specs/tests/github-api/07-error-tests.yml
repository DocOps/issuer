      # Error Handling Test
      
      This issue should **NOT** be created successfully because the repository doesn't exist.
      
      **What this tests:**
      - Error handling for invalid repository names
      - Graceful failure with informative error messages
      - No crashes or unexpected behavior
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      - The CLI should detect that the repository doesn't exist
      - A clear error message should be displayed
      - The program should exit gracefully without creating any issues
      - No partial state should be left behind
      
      **Test commands:**
      ```bash
      # This should fail with a clear error message
      issuer 07-error-tests.yml --dry    # Should fail even in dry-run
      issuer 07-error-tests.yml          # Should fail with repository error
      ```
      
      If you're seeing this issue in GitHub, something went wrong with the test!
