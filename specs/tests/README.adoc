= GitHub API Integration Testing Suite
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 3

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the issuer CLI's GitHub API integration functionality.

toc::[]

== Overview

The testing suite validates:

* GitHub API authentication and connectivity
* Issue creation with various configurations
* Milestone/version management
* Label/tag management  
* Assignment functionality
* Automation flags (`--auto-metadata`, etc.)
* Error handling and edge cases
* Run logging and artifact tracking

== Artifact Logging System

The issuer CLI automatically logs all created artifacts (issues, milestones, labels) to `~/.config/issuer/logs/` directory (user-wide) for tracking and potential cleanup operations.

=== How It Works

When you run issuer with live operations (not `--dry`):

. *Run Tracking*: A unique run ID is generated (example: `run_20250711_143022_abcd`)
. *Artifact Logging*: All created issues, milestones, and labels are logged with metadata
. *Status Tracking*: Run status is tracked (`in_progress`, `completed`, `failed`)
. *JSON Storage*: All data is stored in JSON format in `~/.config/issuer/logs/<RUN_ID>.json`

=== Log Structure

Each run log contains:

[source,json]
----
{
  "run_id": "run_20250711_143022_abcd",
  "started_at": "2025-07-11T14:30:22Z",
  "status": "completed",
  "metadata": { "issues_planned": 15 },
  "artifacts": {
    "issues": [
      {
        "number": 42,
        "title": "Fix authentication bug",
        "url": "https://github.com/user/repo/issues/42",
        "created_at": "2025-07-11T14:30:25Z",
        "repository": "user/repo"
      }
    ],
    "milestones": [ ... ],
    "labels": [ ... ]
  },
  "summary": {
    "issues_created": 15,
    "milestones_created": 2,
    "labels_created": 5
  },
  "completed_at": "2025-07-11T14:32:15Z"
}

=== Testing with Logging

During test runs, artifacts are automatically logged. This enables:

Verification:: Confirm that all expected artifacts were created
Debugging:: Track what was created when tests fail
Cleanup Planning::
Prepare for future cleanup script development

The test cleanup scripts can read these logs to understand what needs to be cleaned up.

=== Run Management Script

A standalone script is available for managing cached runs:

[source,bash]
----
# List all cached runs
bundle exec ruby scripts/manage-runs.rb list

# List recent runs only (last 10)
bundle exec ruby scripts/manage-runs.rb list --recent

# Show detailed information for a specific run
bundle exec ruby scripts/manage-runs.rb show run_20250711_180124_97d1f1f3

# Clean all log files (use with caution)
bundle exec ruby scripts/manage-runs.rb clean-logs
----

This script provides a convenient way to inspect what artifacts were created during testing without needing to manually parse JSON files.

== Quick Start

=== 1. Setup Configuration

Copy the example config file and customize it:

[source,bash]
----
cp specs/tests/github-api/config.yml.example specs/tests/github-api/config.yml
----

Edit `config.yml` with your test repository and GitHub username:

[source,yaml]
----
test_repo: "your-username/issuer-test-repo"
test_username: "your-username"
cleanup_after_tests: false
dry_run_first: true
verbose_output: false
----

=== 2. Set GitHub Token

Ensure you have a GitHub personal access token set:

[source,bash]
----
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
# or any of: GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN, ISSUER_API_TOKEN, ISSUER_GITHUB_TOKEN
----

=== 3. Create Test Repository

Create a GitHub repository for testing (or use an existing one):

[source,bash]
----
gh repo create issuer-test-repo --public --description "Test repository for issuer CLI"
----

=== 4. Run Tests

Execute the complete test suite:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh
----

Or run with options:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh --verbose --no-dry-run

[%interactive]
- [ ] All issues are created without errors
- [ ] Milestones are created when needed
- [ ] Labels are created when needed  
- [ ] Assignments work correctly
- [ ] Automation flags work as expected
- [ ] Error scenarios fail gracefully

== Cleanup

=== Automated Cleanup

Run the cleanup script to remove test artifacts:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/cleanup-github-tests.sh your-username/test-repo
----

Options:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/cleanup-github-tests.sh --help                    # Show help
./specs/tests/cleanup-github-tests.sh --dry-run your-repo       # Show what would be cleaned
./specs/tests/cleanup-github-tests.sh --issues-only your-repo   # Only clean issues
----

=== Manual Cleanup

The cleanup script generates commands for manual execution if needed.

Test artifacts to clean up:
* Issues with `[TEST]` in the title
* Milestones with `test-*` patterns
* Labels with `test-*` patterns

== Continuous Integration

=== Pre-commit Testing

Run basic tests before committing:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh --no-dry-run --non-interactive
----

=== Release Testing

Run full test suite before releases:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh --verbose --cleanup
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

. *Authentication Errors*
+
----
GitHub token not found in environment variables
----
+
Solution: Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` or other token environment variables

. *Repository Access Errors*
+
----
Not Found (HTTP 404)
----
+
Solution: Verify repository name and token permissions

. *Rate Limiting*
+
----
API rate limit exceeded
----
+
Solution: Wait or use a token with higher rate limits

. *Permission Errors*
+
----
Resource not accessible by integration
----
+
Solution: Ensure token has Issues read/write permissions

=== Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output to see detailed information:

[source,bash]
----
./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh --verbose
----

=== Individual Test Execution

Run individual test files manually:

[source,bash]
----
# Update test file with your repo first
sed -i 's/your-username\/issuer-test-repo/yourusername\/yourrepo/g' specs/tests/github-api/01-auth-connection.yml

# Run the test
issuer specs/tests/github-api/01-auth-connection.yml --dry
issuer specs/tests/github-api/01-auth-connection.yml
----

== Test Development

=== Adding New Tests

. Create a new `.yml` file in `specs/tests/github-api/`
. Follow the naming convention: `NN-description.yml`
. Use `[TEST]` prefix in issue summaries
. Update the test runner script to include the new test
. Document expected behavior in issue bodies

=== Test File Template

[source,yaml]
----
$meta:
  proj: your-username/issuer-test-repo
  
issues:
  - summ: "[TEST] Description of what this tests"
    body: |
      # Test Description
      
      **What this tests:**
      - Feature 1
      - Feature 2
      
      **Expected behavior:**
      - Expected outcome 1
      - Expected outcome 2
      
      **Test commands:**
      ```bash
      issuer test-file.yml --dry
      issuer test-file.yml --auto-metadata
      ```
----

== Integration with CI/CD

=== GitHub Actions

Example workflow for automated testing:

[source,yaml]
----
name: GitHub API Integration Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        bundler-cache: true
    - name: Run GitHub API tests
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        # Setup test configuration
        cp specs/tests/github-api/config.yml.example specs/tests/github-api/config.yml
        sed -i 's/your-username/github-actions-test/g' specs/tests/github-api/config.yml
        
        # Run tests
        ./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh --non-interactive --cleanup
----

=== Local Development

Set up a git hook for pre-commit testing:

[source,bash]
----
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
echo "Running GitHub API integration tests..."
./specs/tests/run-github-api-tests.sh --no-dry-run --non-interactive
----

== Security Considerations

. *Token Security*: Never commit GitHub tokens to version control
. *Test Repository*: Use a dedicated test repository, not production repos  
. *Cleanup*: Always clean up test artifacts to avoid clutter
. *Rate Limits*: Be mindful of GitHub API rate limits during testing
. *Permissions*: Use tokens with minimal required permissions

== Contributing

When contributing to the test suite:

. *Add tests for new features*: Every new feature should have corresponding tests
. *Update existing tests*: Modify tests when changing functionality
. *Test edge cases*: Include tests for error conditions and edge cases
. *Document expectations*: Clearly document what each test validates
. *Clean up*: Ensure tests can be cleaned up properly

== Support

For issues with the testing suite:

. Check the troubleshooting section above
. Review test logs in `specs/tests/results/`
. Run individual tests manually for debugging
. Open an issue in the main repository with:
* Test configuration used
* Error messages
* Expected vs actual behavior
