  - chid: 21-fixed-jira-refere
    tick: 21
    type: bugfix
    part: documentation
    summ: Fixed JIRA references (Jira)
    lead: briandominick

  - chid: 29-option-alias-v-t
    tick: 29
    type: deprecation
    part: cli
    summ: Option alias -v to be removed in 1.0.0
    note: |
      The CLI option `-v`, which is an alias for the option `--version`, is to be removed in the version 1.0.0 release. This option conflicts with options typically used in our other CLI utilities for different purposes.

  - chid: 26-option-tokenv-t
    tick: 26
    type: deprecation
    part: cli
    summ: Option --tokenv to be removed in 1.0.0
    note: |
      The clever but ultimately redundant CLI option `--tokenv ENV_VAR_NAME` will be removed in the 1.0.0 release. Use an inline environment variable by aliasing it to a supported keyname, such as `ISSUER_API_KEY=$MY_GITHUB_TOKEN issuer issues.yml`.

  - chid: 3-added-type-prop
    tick: 3
    type: feature
    part: imyml
    summ: Added 'type' property to issue mapping and defaults
    note: |
      A new `type` property of the IMYML definition structure has been added to accommodate GitHub's new issue-typing system. This change adds support for GH's GraphQL API, as that was the only way to create new issue items with `type` metadata.
    lead: briandominick

  - chid: added-releasehx-support
    type: feature
    part: documentation
    summ: Added ReleaseHx support for generating release history
    note: |
      This release of issuer was delayed a few weeks while I worked on its sibling app, ReleaseHx, which is still pre-release but was used to fetch data from the GitHub Issues API and generate the release history you are reading now.
