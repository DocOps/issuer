    summ: Added a `--json [PATH]` option for writing locally instead of to remote API
    note: |
      The `--json` flag stores the prepared REST API issue payloads as a single JSON file in the exact form used for the API. The JSON file saves to PATH, which defaults to `_payloads/` locally.

      Use `--dry` when you want to skip posting and only export the payloads.

      == Release Note

      Added a CLI option to save GitHub API issue payloads as JSON files locally, enabling payload inspection and workflow automation.

    part: cli
    summ: Made `issuer help` commandline return help screen instead of error
    note: |
      Running the command with `help` as the first/only argument returns `Error: File not found: help` when it should return the help/usage screen.
